This distribution provide version 0.01 of the Digest::SHA1 module.  It
is a very simple adaptor for Uwe Hollerbach's SHA.pm module that make
it conform to the common Digest:: module interface.  It is currently
needed to make the Digest::HMAC_SHA1 module distributed in the
Digest-MD5 distribution work.

The plan is that Uwe will provide a real Digest::SHA1 implementation
soon, and make SHA.pm be "emulated" instead.  This module will go away
then.

See also L<Digest> and L<Digest::MD5> found in the Digest-MD5
distribution.
